# The General Process
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
- Collect Data from NHTSA (CSV)
- Extract, transfer, load, (ETL) and MySQL schema creation and population (Python, Pandas, SQL)
  - Using Pandas to convert CSVs to data frames, I learned more about the dataset and cleaned it up.
  - Uploaded data to MySQL database into a schema that I created.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) (SQL, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statistical Analysis)
  - Dived into the data and it's story. Utilized my knowledge in data analytics and statistics to find significant trends and differences. Details in [NB]()
