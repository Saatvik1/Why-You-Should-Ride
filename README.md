# Why-You-Should-Ride

## Project Plan: 
### Context and Ideation: 
#### There are millions of motorcyclists in the U.S. It's a popular hobby for many, and is a part of many cultures. While it may be fun and thrilling to ride motorcycles, it also comes with its disadvantages and risks. As an aspiring and beginner rider, I want my fellow riders to stay as safe as possible. My goal is to raise awareness, beyond the known knowdledge that motorcycles is dangerous, so that riders can take specific actions to ride safely instead of recieving the common fear mongering comment.
